{pstd}
Standard inference about a scalar parameter estimated via GMM amounts to 
applying a t-test to a particular set of observations. If the number of 
observations is not very large, then moderately heavy tails can lead to poor
behaviour of the t-test.
This package implements the method described in 
{help robttest##mainpaper:Müller (2020)}, which combines extreme value theory for the smallest and
largest observations with a normal approximation for the average of the 
remaining observations to construct a more robust alternative to the t-test.
This new test controls size more succesfully in small samples compared to 
existing methods.
It is implemented as a postestimation command that can be used after the Stata commands {manhelp regress R:regress}, {manhelp ivregress R:ivregress}, {manhelp areg R:areg}, {manhelp logit R:logit} or {manhelp probit R:probit},
as long as these are used with the standard error option {it:robust} or {it:cluster} (see {manhelp vce_option R:vce option}).
P-values take values on the grid 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008, 0.01, 0.02, 0.030, 0.04, 
0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.10, 0.12, 0.14, 0.16, 0.18, 0.2, 0.25, 
0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0. The reported p-value is the largest value on this grid 
so that all tests of that level and smaller reject. Thus, the reported p-value 
is to be interpreted as an upper bound, that is if it was computed with a finer grid 
of levels, it would be smaller than the one that is reported, but not as small as 
the next smallest value in the grid above. In particular, a value of 0.002 means
that tests of all considered levels reject, and a p-value of 1.0 means that 
the test of level 0.5 does not reject.

{opt k(#)} overrides default value for {it:k}th order statistic; supported values are 4 and 8 {help robttest##mainpaper:Müller (2020)} for details.

{phang}
{opt verbose} displays the 2{it:k} extreme terms, in multiples of standard deviation of sum of middle {it:n}-2{it:k} terms.

Additionally, {cmd:robttest} preserves all macros and scalars of the estimated model in memory.
